### Introduction

In `macro_rules!` `$crate` is used to get the path of the crate where a macro is declared in. In
procedural macros there is currently no easy way to get this path. A common hack is to import the
desired crate with a know name and use this. However, with rust edition 2018 and dropping
`extern crate` declarations from `lib.rs`, people start to rename crates in `Cargo.toml` directly.
However, this breaks importing the crate, as the proc-macro developer does not know the renamed
name of the crate that should be imported.

This crate provides a way to get the name of a crate, even if it renamed in `Cargo.toml`. For this
purpose a single function `crate_name` is provided. This function needs to be called in the context
of a proc-macro with the name of the desired crate. `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` will be used to find the
current active `Cargo.toml` and this `Cargo.toml` is searched for the desired crate. The returned
name of `crate_name` is either the given original rename (crate not renamed) or the renamed name.

### Example

```rust
use quote::quote;
use proc_macro_crate::crate_name;

fn import_my_crate() {
    let name = crate_name("my-crate").expect("my-crate is present in `Cargo.toml`");
    quote!( extern crate #name as my_crate_known_name );
}

```
